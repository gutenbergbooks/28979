<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>Over a quarter of a century ago, while engaged in
introducing the American public school system into
Japan, I became acquainted in Tokio with Mrs. Matilda
Chaplin Ayrton, the author of "Child-Life in Japan."
This highly accomplished lady was a graduate of Edinburgh
University, and had obtained the degrees of
Bachelor of Letters and Bachelor of Sciences, besides
studying medicine in Paris. She had married Professor
William Edward Ayrton, the electric engineer and inventor,
then connected with the Imperial College of
Engineering of Japan, and since president of the Institute
of Electric Engineers in London. She took a keen
interest in the Japanese people and never wearied of
studying them and their beautiful country. With my
sister, she made excursions to some of the many famous
places in the wonderful city of Tokio. When her own
little daughter, born among the camellias and chrysanthemums,
grew up under her Japanese nurse, Mrs.
Ayrton became more and more interested in the home
life of the Japanese and in the pictures and stories
which delighted the children of the Mikado's Empire.
After her return to England, in 1879, she wrote this
book.</p>

<p>In the original work, the money and distances, the
comparisons and illustrations, were naturally English,
and not American. For this reason, I have ventured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
to alter the text slightly here and there, that the American
child reader may more clearly catch the drift of
the thought, have given to each Japanese word the
standard spelling now preferred by scholars and omitted
statements of fact which were once, but are no longer,
true. I have also translated or omitted hard Japanese
words, shortened long sentences, rearranged the illustrations,
and added notes which will make the subject
clearer. Although railways, telegraphs, and steamships,
clothes and architecture, schools and customs, patterned
more or less closely after those in fashion in America
and Europe, have altered many things in Japan and
caused others to disappear, yet the children's world of
toys and games and stories does not change very fast.
In the main, it may be said, we have here a true picture
of the old Japan which we all delighted in seeing, when,
in those sunny days, we lived in sight of Yedo Bay and
Fuji Yama, with Japanese boys and girls all around us.</p>

<p>The best portions and all the pictures of Mrs. Ayrton's
big and costly book have been retained and reproduced,
including her own preface or introduction, and
the book is again set forth with a hearty "ohio" (good
morning) of salutation and sincere "omédéto" (congratulations)
that the nations of the world are rapidly becoming
one family. May every reader of "Child-Life in
Japan" see, sometime during the twentieth century, the
country and the people of whom Mrs. Ayrton has written
with such lively spirit and such warm appreciation.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>In almost every home are Japanese fans, in our
shops Japanese dolls and balls and other knick-knacks,
on our writing-tables bronze crabs or lacquered
pen-tray with outlined on it the extinct
volcano [Fuji San]<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> that is the most striking
mountain seen from the capital of Japan. At
many places of amusement Japanese houses of
real size have been exhibited, and the jargon of
fashion for "Japanese Art" even reaches our
children's ears.</p>

<p>Yet all these things seem dull and lifeless when
thus severed from the quaint cheeriness of their
true home. To those familiar with Japan, that
bamboo fan-handle recalls its graceful grassy tree,
the thousand and one daily purposes for which
bamboo wood serves. We see the open shop
where squat the brown-faced artisans cleverly
dividing into those slender divisions the fan-handle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
the wood-block engraver's where some
dozen men sit patiently chipping at their cherry-wood
blocks, and the printer's where the coloring
arrangements seem so simple to those used to
western machinery, but where the colors are so
rich and true. We see the picture stuck on the
fan frame with starch paste, and drying in the
brilliant summer sunlight. The designs recall
vividly the life around, whether that life be the
stage, the home, insects, birds, or flowers. We
think of halts at wayside inns, when bowing tea-house
girls at once proffer these fans to hot and
tired guests.</p>

<p>The tonsured oblique-eyed doll suggests the
festival of similarly oblique-eyed little girls on the
3rd of March. Then dolls of every degree obtain
for a day "Dolls' Rights." In every Japanese
household all the dolls of the present and previous
generations are, on that festival, set out to
best advantage. Beside them are sweets, green-speckled
rice cake, and daintily gilt and lacquered
dolls' utensils. For some time previous, to meet
the increased demand, the doll shopman has been
very busy. He sits before a straw-holder into
which he can readily stick, to dry, the wooden
supports of the plaster dolls' heads he is painting,
as he takes first one and then another to give
artistic touches to their glowing cheeks or little
tongue. That dolly that seems but "so odd" to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
Polly or Maggie is there the cherished darling of
its little owner. It passes half its day tied on to
her back, peeping companionably its head over
her shoulder. At night it is lovingly sheltered
under the green mosquito curtains, and provided
with a toy wooden pillow.</p>

<p>The expression "Japanese Art" seems but a
created word expressing either the imitations of it,
or the artificial transplanting of Japanese things
to our houses. The whole glory of art in Japan
is, that it is not Art, but Nature simply rendered,
by a people with a fancy and love of fun quite
Irish in character. Just as Greek sculptures
were good, because in those days artists modelled
the corsetless life around them, so the Japanese
artist does not draw well his lightly draped figures,
cranes, and insects because these things
strike him as beautiful, but because he is familiar
with their every action.</p>

<p>The Japanese house out of Japan seems but a
dull and listless affair. We miss the idle, easy-going
life and chatter, the tea, the sweetmeats,
the pipes and charcoal brazier, the clogs awaiting
their wearers on the large flat stone at the entry,
the grotesquely trained ferns, the glass balls and
ornaments tinkling in the breeze, that hang, as
well as lanterns, from the eaves, the garden with
tiny pond and goldfish, bridge and miniature hill,
the bright sunshine beyond the sharp shadow of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
the upward curving angles of the tiled roof, the
gay, scarlet folds of the women's under-dress
peeping out, their little litter of embroidery or
mending, and the babies, brown and half naked,
scrambling about so happily. For, what has a
baby to be miserable about in a land where it is
scarcely ever slapped, where its clothing, always
loose, is yet warm in winter, where it basks freely
in air and sunshine? It lives in a house, that
from its thick grass mats, its absence of furniture,
and therefore of commands "not to touch," is the
very beau-ideal of an infant's playground.</p>

<p>The object with which the following pages
were written, was that young folks who see and
handle so often Japanese objects, but who find
books of travels thither too long and dull for their
reading, might catch a glimpse of the spirit that
pervades life in the "Land of the Rising Sun."
A portion of the book is derived from translations
from Japanese tales, kindly given to the author
by Mr. Basil H. Chamberlain, whilst the rest was
written at idle moments during graver studies.</p>

<p>The games and sports of Japanese children
have been so well described by Professor Griffis,
that we give, as an Appendix, his account of their
doings.</p>

<span class="caption">A Ride on a Bamboo
Rail.</span>
</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="nodisp">T</span>hese little boys all live a long
way off in islands called
"Japan." They have all rather
brown chubby faces, and they
are very merry. Unless they
give themselves a really hard
knock they seldom get cross or
cry.</p>

<p>In the second large picture
two of the little boys are playing
at snowball. Although it
may be hotter in the summer
in their country than it is here, the winter is as
cold as you feel it. Like our own boys, these lads
enjoy a fall of snow, and still better than snowballing
they like making a snowman with a charcoal
ball for each eye and a streak of charcoal for his
mouth. The shoes which they usually wear out
of doors are better for a snowy day than your
boots, for their feet do not sink into the snow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
unless it is deep. These shoes are of wood, and
make a boy seem to be about three inches taller
than he really is. The shoe, you see, has not laces
or buttons, but is kept on the foot by that thong
which passes between the first and second toe.
The thong is made of grass, and covered with
strong paper, or with white or colored calico.
The boy in the check dress wears his shoes without
socks, but you see the other boy has socks on.
His socks are made of dark blue calico, with a
thickly woven sole, and a place, like one finger of
a glove, for his big toe. If you were to wear Japanese
shoes, you would think the thong between
your toes very uncomfortable. Yet from their
habit of wearing this sort of shoe, the big toe
grows more separate from the other toes, and the
skin between this and the next toe becomes as
hard as the skin of a dog's or a cat's paw.</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="nodisp">T</span>he boys are not cold, for their cotton clothes,
being wadded, are warm and snug. One boy has
a rounded pouch fastened to his sash. It is red
and prettily embroidered with flowers or birds,
and is his purse, in which he keeps some little
toys and some money. The other boy very likely
has not a pouch, but he has two famous big
pockets. Like all Japanese, he uses the part of
his large sleeve which hangs down as his pocket.
Thus when a group of little children are disturbed
at play you see each little hand seize a treasured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
toy and disappear into its sleeve, like mice running
into their holes with bits of cheese.</p>

<p>In the next large picture are two boys who are
fond of music. One has a flute, which is made
of bamboo wood. These flutes are easy to make,
as bamboo wood grows hollow, with cross divisions
at intervals. If you cut a piece with a
division forming one end you need only make the
outside holes in order to finish your flute.</p>

<p>The child sitting down
has a drum. His drum
and the paper lanterns
hanging up have painted on
them an ornament which
is also the crest of the
house of "Arima."<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> If
these boys belong to this
family they wear the same
crest embroidered on the centre of the backs of
their coats.</p>

<span class="caption">Kangura, or Korean Lion
Play</span>
</div>

<p>Korean Lion is the title of the picture which
forms the frontispiece; it represents a game
that children in Japan are very fond of playing.
They are probably trying to act as well
as the maskers did whom they saw on New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
Year's Day, just as our children try and imitate
things they see in a pantomime. The masker goes
from house to house accompanied by one or two
men who play on cymbals, flute, and drum. He
steps into a shop where the people of the house
and their friends sit drinking tea, and passers-by
pause in front of the open shop to see the fun.
He takes a mask, like the one in the picture, off
his back and puts it over his head. This boar's-head
mask is painted scarlet and black, and gilt.
It has a green cloth hanging down behind, in
order that you may not perceive where the mask
ends and the mans body begins. Then the
masker imitates an animal. He goes up to a
young lady and lays down his ugly head beside
her to be patted, as "Beast" may have coaxed
"Beauty" in the fairy
tale. He grunts, and
rolls, and scratches himself.
The children almost
forget he is a man, and
roar with laughter at
the funny animal. When
they begin to tire of this
fun he exchanges this mask for some of the two
or three others he carries with him. He puts
on a mask of an old woman over his face, and
at the back of his head a very different second
mask, a cloth tied over the centre of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
head, making the two faces yet more distinct from
each other. He has quickly arranged the back
of his dress to look like the front of a person, and
he acts, first presenting the one person to his
spectators, then the other. He makes you even
imagine he has four arms, so cleverly can he twist
round his arm and gracefully fan what is in reality
the back of his head.</p>

<span class="caption">Ironclad Top Game.</span>
</div>

<p>The tops the lads are playing with in this picture
are not quite the same shape as our tops,
but they spin very well. Some men are so clever
at making spinning-tops run along strings, throwing
them up into the air and catching them with
a tobacco-pipe, that they earn a living by exhibiting
their skill.</p>

<p>Some of the tops are formed of short pieces of
bamboo with a wooden peg put through them,
and the hole cut in the side makes them have
a fine hum as the air rushes in whilst they
spin.</p>

<p>The boys in the next large picture must
be playing with the puppies of a large dog, to
judge from their big paws. There are a great
many large dogs in the streets of Tokio; some
are very tame, and will let children comb their
hair and ornament them and pull them about.
These dogs do not wear collars, as do our pet
dogs, but a wooden label bearing the owner's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
name is hung round their necks. Other big
dogs are almost wild.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<span class="caption">Playing with Doggy.</span>
</div>

<p>Half-a-dozen of these dogs will lie in one place,
stretched drowsily on the grassy city walls under
the trees, during the daytime. Towards evening
they rouse themselves and run off to yards and
rubbish-heaps to pick up what they can. They
will eat fish, but two or three dogs soon get to
know where the meat-eating Englishmen live.
They come trotting in regularly with a business-like
air to search among the day's refuse for
bones. Should any interloping dog try to establish
a right to share the feast he can only gain
his footing after a victorious battle. All these
dogs are very wolfish-looking, with straight hair,
which is usually white or tan-colored. There
are other pet dogs kept in houses. These look
something like spaniels. They are small, with
their black noses so much turned up that it
seems as if, when they were puppies, they had
tumbled down and broken the bridge of their
nose. They are often ornamented like dog Toby
in "Punch and Judy," with a ruff made of some
scarlet stuff round their necks.</p>

<span class="caption">Heron-legs, or Stilts.</span>
</div>

<p>After the heavy autumn rains have filled the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
roads with big puddles, it is great fun, this boy
thinks, to walk about on stilts. You see him on
page 11. His stilts are of bamboo wood, and
he calls them "Heron-legs," after the long-legged
snowy herons that strut about in the wet rice-fields.
When he struts about on them, he
wedges the upright between his big and second
toe as if the stilt was like his shoes. He has a
good view of his two friends who are wrestling,
and probably making hideous noises like wild
animals as they try to throw one another. They
have seen fat public wrestlers stand on opposite
sides of a sanded ring, stoop, rubbing their
thighs, and in a crouching attitude and growling,
slowly advance upon one another. Then
when near to one another, the spring is made
and the men close. If after some time the round
is not decided by a throw, the umpire, who struts
about like a turkey-cock, fanning himself, approaches.
He plucks the girdle of the weaker
combatant, when the wrestlers at once retire to
the sides of the arena to rest, and to sprinkle a
little water over themselves.</p>

<span class="caption">The Young Wrestlers.</span>
</div>

<p>In the neighborhood in which the children
shown in the picture live, there is a temple.
In honor of the god a feast-day is
held on the tenth of every month. The tenth
day of the tenth month is a yet greater feast-day.
On these days they go the first thing in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
the morning to the barber's, have their heads
shaved and dressed, and their faces powdered
with white, and their lips and cheeks
painted pink. They wear their best clothes
and smartest sashes. Then they clatter off on
their wooden clogs to the temple and buy two
little rice-cakes at the gates. Next they come to
two large, comical bronze dogs sitting on stands,
one on each side of the path. They reach up
and gently rub the dog's nose, then rub their own
noses, rub the dog's eyes, and then their own, and
so on, until they have touched the dog's and their
own body all over. This is their way of praying
for good health. They also add another to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
number of little rags that have been hung by
each visitor about the dog's neck. Then they
go to the altar and give their cakes to a boy
belonging to the temple. In exchange he presents
them with one rice-cake which has been
blessed. They ring a round brass bell to call
their god's attention, and throw him some money
into a grated box as big as a child's crib. Then
they squat down and pray to be good little boys.
Now they go out and amuse themselves by looking
at all the stalls of toys and cakes, and flowers
and fish.</p>

<p>The man who sells the gold-fish, with fan-like
tails as long as their bodies, has also turtles.
These boys at last settle that of all the pretty
things they have seen they would best like to
spend their money on a young turtle. For their
pet rabbits and mice died, but turtles, they say,
are painted on fans and screens and boxes because
turtles live for ten thousand years. Even
the noble white crane is said to live no more
than a thousand years. In this picture they have
carried home the turtle and are much amused at
the funny way it walks and peeps its head in and
out from under its shell.</p>

<h2><a name="FIRST_MONTH" id="FIRST_MONTH"></a>FIRST MONTH.</h2>

<p>Little Good Boy had just finished eating the
last of five rice cakes called "dango," that had
been strung on a skewer of bamboo and dipped
in soy sauce, when he said to his little sister,
called Chrysanthemum:&mdash;</p>

<p>"O-Kiku, it is soon the great festival of the
New Year."</p>

<p>"What shall we do then?" asked little O-Kiku,
not clearly remembering the festival of the previous
year.</p>

<p>Thus questioned, Yoshi-san<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> had his desired
opening to hold forth on the coming delights,
and he replied:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Men will come the evening before the great
feast-day and help Plum-blossom, our maid, to
clean all the house with brush and broom.
Others will set up the decoration in front of our
honored gateway. They will dig two small holes
and plant a gnarled, black-barked father-pine
branch on the left, and the slighter reddish
mother-pine branch on the right. They will then
put with these the tall knotted stem of a bamboo,
with its smooth, hard green leaves that chatter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
when the wind blows. Next they will take a grass
rope, about as long as a tall man, fringed with
grass, and decorated with zigzag strips of white
paper. These, our noble father says, are meant
for rude images of men offering themselves in
homage to the august gods."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! I have not forgotten," interrupts
Chrysanthemum, "this cord is stretched from
bamboo to bamboo; and Plum-blossom says the
rope is to bar out the nasty two-toed, red, gray,
and black demons, the badgers, the foxes, and
other evil spirits from crossing our threshold.
But I think it is the next part of the arch which
is the prettiest, the whole bunch of things they
tie in the middle of the rope. There is the
crooked-back lobster, like a bowed old man, with
all around the camellia branches, whose young
leaves bud before the old leaves fall. There are
pretty fern leaves shooting forth in pairs, and
deep down between them the little baby fern-leaf.
There is the bitter yellow orange, whose
name, you know, means 'many parents and children.'
The name of the black piece of charcoal
is a pun on our homestead."</p>

<p>"But best of all," says Yoshi-san, "I like the
seaweed hontawara, for it tells me of our brave
Queen Jingu Kogo, who, lest the troops should
be discouraged, concealed from the army that her
husband the king had died, put on armor, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
led the great campaign against Korea.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Her
troops, stationed at the margin of the sea, were
in danger of defeat on account of the lack of
fodder for their horses; when she ordered this
hontawara to be plucked from the shore, and
the horses, freshened by their meal of seaweed,
rushed victoriously to battle. On the bronzed
clasp of our worthy father's tobacco-pouch is,
our noble father says, the Queen with her
sword and the dear little baby prince,<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Hachiman,
who was born after the campaign, and
who is now our Warrior God,<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> guiding our
troops to victory, and that spirit on whose head
squats a dragon has risen partly from the deep,
to present an offering to the Queen and the
Prince."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>
<p>"Then there is another seaweed, whose name
is a pun on 'rejoicing.' There is the lucky bag
that I made, for last year, of a square piece of
paper into which we put chestnuts and the roe
of a herring and dried persimmon fruit. Then
I tied up the paper with red and white paper-string,
that the sainted gods might know it was
an offering."</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;Bronze fishes
sitting on
their throats.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Yoshi-san and his little sister had now reached
the great gate ornamented with huge
bronze fishes<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> sitting on their throats
and twisting aloft their forked tails,
that was near their home. He
told his sister she must wait to
know more about the great festival
till the time arrived. They shuffled
off their shoes, bowed, till their
foreheads touched the ground, to
their parents, ate their evening
bowl of rice and salt fish, said a prayer and burnt
a stick of incense to many-armed Buddha at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
family altar. They spread their cotton-wadded
quilts, rested their dear little shaved heads, with
quaint circlet of hair, on the roll of cotton covered
with white paper that formed the cushion of their
hard wooden pillows. Soon they fell asleep to
their mother's monotonously chanted lullaby of
"Nenné ko."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sleep, my child, sleep, my child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where is thy nurse gone?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She is gone to the mountains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To buy thee sweetmeats.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What shall she buy thee?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thundering drum, the bamboo pipe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The trundling man, or the paper kite."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The great festival drew still nearer, to the children's
delight, as they watched the previously
described graceful bamboo arch rise before their
gateposts. Then came a party of three with an
oven, a bottomless tub, and some matting to
replace the bottom. They shifted the pole that
carried these utensils from their shoulders, and
commenced to make the Japanese cake that may
be viewed as the equivalent of a Christmas pudding.
They mixed a paste of rice and put the
sticky mass, to prevent rebounding, on the soft
mat in the tub. The third man then beat for
a long time the rice cake with a heavy mallet.
Yoshi-san liked to watch the strong man swing
down his mallet with dull resounding thuds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
The well-beaten dough was then made up into
flattish rounds of varying size on a pastry board
one of the men had brought. Three cakes of
graduated size formed a pyramid that was placed
conspicuously on a lacquered stand, and the cakes
were only to be eaten on the 11th of January.</p>

<p>The mother told Plum-blossom and the children
to get their clogs and overcoats and hoods,
for she was going to get the New Year's decorations.
The party shuffled off till they came to a
stall where were big grass ropes and fringes and
quaint grass boats filled with supposed bales of
merchandise in straw coverings, a sun in red paper,
and at bow and stern sprigs of fir. The whole was
brightened by bits of gold leaf, lightly stuck on,
that quivered here and there. When the children
had chosen the harvest ship that seemed most
besprinkled with gold, Plum-blossom bargained
about the price. The mother, as a matter of
form and rank, had pretended to take no interest
in the purchase. She took her purse out of
her sash, handed it to her servant, who opened it,
paid the shopman, and then returned the purse
to her mistress. This she did with the usual
civility of first raising it to her forehead. The
decorations they hung up in their sitting-room.
Then they sent presents, such as large dried carp,
tea, eggs, shoes, kerchiefs, fruits, sweets, or toys
to various friends and dependants.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 1st of January all were early astir, for
the father, dressed at dawn in full European evening
dress,<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> as is customary on such occasions, had
to pay his respects at the levee of the Emperor.
When this duty was over, he returned home
and received visitors of rank inferior to himself.
Later in the day and on the following day he paid
visits of New Year greeting to all his friends. He
took a present to those to whom he had sent no
gift. Sometimes he had his little boy with him.
For these visits Yoshi-san, in place of his usual
flowing robe, loose trousers, and sash, wore a
funny little knickerbocker suit, felt hat, and boots.
These latter, though he thought them grand, felt
very uncomfortable after his straw sandals. They
were more troublesome to take off before stepping
on the straw mats, that, being used as chairs
as well as carpets, it would be a rudeness to soil.
The maids, always kneeling, presented them with
tiny cups of tea on oval saucers, which, remaining
in the maid's hand, served rather as waiters.
Sweetmeats, too, usually of a soft, sticky nature,
but sometimes hard like sugar-plums, and called
"fire-sweets," were offered on carved lotus-leaf or
lacquered trays.</p>

<p>For the 2nd of January Plum-blossom bought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
some pictures of the treasure-ship or ship of
riches, in which were seated the seven Gods of
Wealth.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> It has been sung thus about this Ship

<p>These pictures they each tied on their pillow
to bring lucky dreams. Great was the laughter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
in the morning when they related their dreams.
Yoshi-san said he had dreamt he had a beautiful
portmanteau full of nice foreign things, such as
comforters, note-books, pencils, india-rubber, condensed
milk, lama, wide-awakes, boots, and brass
jewelry. Just as he opened it, everything vanished
and he found only a torn fan, an odd chop-stick,
a horse's cast straw shoe, and a live crow.</p>

<p>When at home, the children, for the first few
days of the New Year, dressed in their best crepe,
made up in three silken-wadded layers. Their
crest was embroidered on the centre of the back
and on the sleeves of the quaintly flowered long
upper skirt. Beneath its wadded hem peeped
the scarlet rolls of the hems of their under-dresses,
and then the white-stockinged feet, with, passing
between the toes, the scarlet thong of the black-lacquered
clog. The little girl's sash was of
many-flowered brocade, with scarlet broidered
pouch hanging at her right side. A scarlet over-sash
kept the large sash-knot in its place. Her
hair was gay with knot of scarlet crinkled crepe,
lacquered comb, and hairpin of tiny golden battledore.
Resting thereon were a shuttlecock of
coral, another pin of a tiny red lobster and a green
pine sprig made of silk. In her belt was coquettishly
stuck the butterfly-broidered case that held
her quire of paper pocket-handkerchiefs. The
brother's dress was of a simpler style and soberer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
coloring. His pouch of purple had a dragon
worked on it, and the hair of his partly shaven
head was tied into a little gummed tail with
white paper-string. They spent most of the day
playing with their pretty new battledores, striking
with its plain side the airy little shuttlecock whose
head is made of a black seed. All the while they
sang a rhyme on the numbers up to ten:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Hitogo ni futa-go&mdash;mi-watashi yo me-go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Itsu yoni musashi nan no yakushi,<br /></span>

<span class="caption">Girls&#39; Ball and Counting Game.</span>
</div>

<p>When tired of this fun, they would play with
a ball made of paper and wadding evenly wound
about with thread or silk of various colors. They
sang to the throws a song which seems abrupt
because some portions have probably fallen into
disuse; it runs thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"See opposite&mdash;see Shin-kawa! A very beautiful
lady who is one of the daughters of a chief
magistrate of Odawara-cho. She was married
to a salt merchant. He was a man fond of display,
and he thought how he would dress her this
year. He said to the dyer, 'Please dye this brocade
and the brocade for the middle dress into
seven-or eight-fold dresses;' and the dyer said,
'I am a dyer, and therefore I will dye and stretch
it. What pattern do you wish?' The merchant
replied, 'The pattern of falling snow and broken
twigs, and in the centre the curved bridge of Gojo.'"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>Then to fill up the rhyme come the words,
"Chokin, chokera, kokin, kokera," and the tale
goes on: "Crossing this bridge the girl was
struck here and there,
and the tea-house girls
laughed. Put out of
countenance by this ridicule,
she drowned herself
in the river Karas, the
body sunk, the hair floated.
How full of grief the husband's
heart&mdash;now the ball counts a hundred."</p>

<p>This they varied with another song:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"One, two, three, four,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grate hard charcoal, shave kiri wood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Put in the pocket, the pocket is wet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kiyomadzu, on three yenoki trees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were three sparrows, chased by a pigeon.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sparrows said, 'Chiu, chiu,'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pigeon said, 'po, po,'&mdash;now the<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ball counts a hundred."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The pocket referred to means the bottom of
the long sleeve, which is apt to trail and get wet
when a child stoops at play. Kiyomadzu may
mean a famous temple that bears that name.
Sometimes they would simply count the turns
and make a sort of game of forfeiting and returning
the number of rebounds kept up by each.</p>

<p>Yoshi-san had begun to think battledore and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
balls too girlish an amusement. He preferred flying
his eagle or mask-like kite, or playing at cards,
verses, or lotteries. Sometimes he played a lively
game with his father, in which the board is divided
into squares and diagonals. On these move sixteen
men held by one player and one large piece
held by the second player. The point of the
game is either that the holder of the sixteen pieces
hedges the large piece so it that can make no
move, or that the big piece takes all its adversaries.
A take can only be made by the large piece
when it finds a piece immediately on each side of
it and a blank point beyond. Or he watched a
party of several, with the pictured sheet of Japanese
backgammon before them, write their names
on slips of paper or wood, and throw in turn a
die. The slips are placed on the pictures whose
numbers correspond with the throw. At the next
round, if the number thrown by the particular
player is written on the picture, he finds directions
as to which picture to move his slip backward or
forward to. He may, however, find his throw
a blank and have to remain at his place. The
winning consists in reaching a certain picture.
When tired of these quieter games, the strolling
woman player on a guitar-like instrument, would be
called in. Or, a party of Kangura boy performers
afforded pastime by the quaint animal-like movements
of the draped figure. He wears a huge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
grotesque scarlet mask on
his head, and at times makes
this monster appear to
stretch out and draw in its
neck by an unseen change in
position of the mask from
the head to the gradually
extended and draped hand
of the actor. The beat of
a drum and the whistle of a
bamboo flute formed the
accompaniment to the dumb-show
acting.</p>

<p>Yoshi-san thought the 4th and 5th days of January
great fun, because loud shoutings were heard.
Running in the direction of the sound, he found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
the men of a fire-brigade who had formed a procession
to carry their new paper standard, bamboo
ladders, paper lanterns, etc. This procession
paused at intervals. Then the men steadied
the ladder with their long fire-hooks, whilst an
agile member of the band mounted the erect
ladder and performed gymnastics at the top. His
performance concluded, he dismounted, and the
march continued, the men as before yelling joyously,
at the highest pitch of their voices.</p>

employments, and the children to school, all having

<h2><a name="THE_CHRYSANTHEMUM_SHOW" id="THE_CHRYSANTHEMUM_SHOW"></a>THE CHRYSANTHEMUM SHOW.</h2>

<p>Yoshi-san and his Grandmother go to visit the
great temple at Shiba. They walk up its steep
stairs, and arrive at the lacquered threshold.
Here they place aside their wooden clogs, throw
a few coins into a huge box standing on the floor.
It is covered with a wooden grating so constructed
as to prevent pilfering hands afterward removing
the coin. Then they pull a thick rope attached
to a big brass bell like an exaggerated sheep-bell,
hanging from the ceiling, but which gives forth
but a feeble, tinkling sound. To insure the god's
attention, this is supplemented with three distinct
claps of the hands, which are afterward clasped
in prayer for a short interval; two more claps
mark the conclusion. Then, resuming their clogs,
they clatter down the steep, copper-bound temple
steps into the grounds. Here are stalls innumerable
of toys, fruit, fish-cakes, birds, tobacco-pipes,
ironmongery, and rice, and scattered amidst the
stalls are tea-houses, peep-shows, and other places
of amusement. Of these the greatest attraction
is a newly-opened chrysanthemum show.</p>

<p>The chrysanthemums are trained to represent
figures. Here is a celebrated warrior, Kato
Kiyomasa by name, who lived about the year
1600, when the eminent Hashiba (Hidéyoshi)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
ruled Japan. Near the end of his reign Hashiba,
wishing to invade China, but being himself unable
to command the expedition, intrusted the leadership
of the fleet and army to Kiyomasa. They
embarked, reached Korea, where a fierce battle
was fought and victory gained by Kiyomasa.
When, however, he returned to Japan, he found
Hidéyoshi had died, and the expedition was therefore
recalled. Tales of the liberality and generosity
of the Chief, and how he, single-handed, had
slain a large and wild tiger with the spear that he
is represented as holding, led to his being at length
addressed as a god. His face is modelled in plaster
and painted, and the yellow chrysanthemum
blossoms may be supposed to be gold bosses on
the verdant armor.</p>

<span class="caption">Eating Stand for the Children.</span>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>Next they looked at eccentric varieties of this
autumn flower, such as those having the petals
longer and more curly than usual. To show off
the flowers every branch was tied to a stick, which
caused Yoshi-san to think the bushes looked a
little stiff and ugly. Near the warrior was a
chrysanthemum-robed lady, Benten, standing in
a flowery sailing-boat that is supposed to contain
a cargo of jewels. Three rabbits farther
on appeared to be chatting together. Perhaps
the best group of all was old Fukurokujin, with
white beard and bald head. He was conversing
with two of the graceful waterfowl so constantly
seen in Japanese decorations. He is the god of
luck, and has a reputation for liking good cheer.
This is suggested by a gourd, a usual form of
wine-bottle, that is suspended to his cane, whilst
another gourd contains homilies. He was said
to be so tender-hearted that even timid wild
fowl were not afraid of him.</p>

<p>Not the least amusing part of the show was
the figure before which Yoshi's Grandmother
exclaimed, "Why, truly, that is clever! Behold,
I pray thee, a barbarian lady, and even her
child!" In truth it was an unconscious caricature
of Europeans, although the lady's face
had not escaped being made to look slightly
Japanese. The child held a toy, and had a
regular shock head of hair. The frizzed hair of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
many foreign children appeared very odd to Yoshi-san.
He thought their mothers must be very
unkind not to take the little "western men" more
often to the barber's. He complacently compared
the neatness of his own shaven crown and
tidily-clipped and gummed side-locks.</p>

<p>Being tired of standing, the old Grandmother
told her grandson they would go and listen to a
recital at the story-teller's. Leaving their wooden
shoes in a pigeon-hole for that purpose, they
joined an attentive throng of some twenty listeners
seated on mats in a dimly-lighted room.
Yoshi could not make out all the tale-teller said,
but he liked to watch him toy with his fan as he
introduced his listeners to the characters of his
story. Then the story-teller would hold his fan
like a rod of command, whilst he kept his audience
in rapt attention, then sometimes, amidst the
laughter of those present, he would raise his
voice to a shrill whine, and would emphasize a
joke by a sharp tap on the table with his fan.
After they had listened to one tale Yoshi-san was
sleepy. So they went and bargained with a man
outside who had a carriage like a small gig with
shafts called a "jin-riki-sha."<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> He ran after them
to say he consented to wheel them home the
two and a half miles for five cents.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="nodisp">T</span>here was once upon a time a
little baby whose father was Japanese
ambassador to the court of
China, and whose mother was a
Chinese lady. While this child
was still in its infancy the ambassador
had to return to Japan. So
he said to his wife, "I swear to
remember you and to send you
letters by the ambassador that shall succeed me;
and as for our baby, I will despatch some one
to fetch it as soon as it is weaned." Thus saying
he departed.</p>

<p>Well, embassy after embassy came (and there
was generally at least a year between each), but
never a letter from the Japanese husband to the
Chinese wife. At last, tired of waiting and of
grieving, she took her boy by the hand, and sorrowfully
leading him to the seashore, fastened round
his neck a label bearing the words, "The
Japanese ambassador's child." Then she flung
him into the sea in the direction of the Japanese
Archipelago, confident that the paternal tie was
one which it was not possible to break, and that
therefore father and child were sure to meet
again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>One day, when the former ambassador, the
father, was riding by the beach of Naniwa
(where afterward was built the city of Osaka),
he saw something white floating out at sea, looking
like a small island. It floated nearer, and he
looked more attentively. There was no doubt
about its being a child. Quite astonished, he
stopped his horse and gazed again. The floating
object drew nearer and nearer still. At last
with perfect distinctness it was perceived to be
a fair, pretty little boy, of about four years old,
impelled onward by the waves.</p>

<span class="caption">Fishsave riding the Dolphin to Japan.</span>
</div>

<p>Still closer inspection showed that the boy
rode bravely on the back of an enormous fish.
When the strange rider had dismounted on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
strand, the ambassador ordered his attendants
to take the manly little fellow in their arms,
when lo, and behold! there was the label round
his neck, on which was written, "The Japanese
ambassador's child." "Oh, yes," he exclaimed,
"it must be my child and no other, whom its
mother, angry at having received no letters from
me, must have thrown into the sea. Now, owing
to the indissoluble bond tying together parents
and children, he has reached me safely, riding
upon a fish's back." The air of the little creature
went to his heart, and he took and tended
him most lovingly.</p>

<p>To the care of the next embassy that went
to the court of China, he intrusted a letter for
his wife, in which he informed her of all the
particulars; and she, who had quite believed
the child to be dead, rejoiced at its marvellous
escape.</p>

<p>The child grew up to be a man, whose handwriting
was beautiful.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Having been saved by a
fish, he was given the name of "Fishsave."</p>

<span class="caption">Bowing before her Mother&#39;s
Mirror.</span>
</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="nodisp">A</span>&nbsp;girl once lived in the
province of Echigo,<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
who from her earliest
years tended her parents
with all filial piety. Her
mother, when, after a long
illness she lay at the point
of death, took out a mirror that she had for many
years concealed, and giving it to her daughter,
spoke thus, "when I have ceased to exist, take
this mirror in thy hand night and morning, and
looking at it, fancy that 'tis I thou seest."</p>

<p>With these last words she expired, and the
girl, full of grief, and faithful to her mother's
commands, used to take out the mirror night and
morning, and gazing in it, saw there in a face like
to the face of her mother. Delighted thereat
(for the village was situated in a remote country
district among the mountains, and a mirror was
a thing the girl had never heard of), she daily
worshipped her reflected face. She bowed before
it till her forehead touched the mat, as if this
image had been in very truth her mother's own
self.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>
<p>Her father one day, astonished to see her thus
occupied, inquired the reason, which she directly
told him. But he burst out laughing, and exclaimed,
"Why! 'tis only thine own face, so like
to thy mother's, that is reflected. It is not thy
mother's at all!"</p>

<p>This revelation distressed the girl. Yet she
replied: "Even if the face be not my mother's, it
is the face of one who belonged to my mother,
and therefore my respectfully saluting it twice
every day is the same as respectfully saluting her
very self." And so she continued to worship the
mirror more and more while tending her father
with all filial piety&mdash;at least so the story goes,
for even to-day, as great poverty and ignorance
prevail in some parts of Echigo, the peasantry
know as little of mirrors as did this little girl.</p>

<p>How curious that the daughter of a peasant
dwelling in a obscure country village near Aska,
in the province of Yamato,<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> should become a
Queen! Yet such was the case. Her father
died while she was yet in her infancy, and the
girl applied herself to the tending of her mother
with all filial piety. One day when she had gone
out in the fields to gather some parsley, of which
her mother was very fond, it chanced that Prince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
Shotoku, the great Buddhist teacher,<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> was making
a progress to his palace, and all the inhabitants of
the country-side flocked to the road along which
the procession was passing, in order to behold the
gorgeous spectacle, and to show their respect
for the Mikado's son. The filial girl, alone, paying
no heed to what was going on around her,
continued picking her parsley. She was observed
from his carriage by the Prince, who, astonished
at the circumstance, sent one of his retainers to
inquire into its cause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>
<p>The girl replied, "My mother bade me pick
parsley, and I am following her instructions&mdash;that
is the reason why I have not turned round
to pay my respects to the Prince." The latter
being informed of her answer, was filled with
admiration at the strictness of her filial piety.
Alighting at her mother's cottage on the way
back, he told her of the occurrence, and placing
the girl in the next carriage to his own, took her
home with him to the Imperial Palace, and
ended by making her his wife, upon which the
people, knowing her story, gave her the name of
the "Parsley Queen."</p>

<h2><a name="THE_TWO_DAUGHTERS" id="THE_TWO_DAUGHTERS"></a>THE TWO DAUGHTERS.</h2>

<p>At Akita, in the province of Inaba, lived an
independent gentleman,<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> who had two daughters,
by whom he was ministered to with all filial piety.
He was fond of shooting with a gun, and thus
very often committed the sin (according to the
teaching of holy Buddha) of taking life.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> He
would never hearken to the admonitions of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
daughters. These, mindful of the future, and
aghast at the prospect in store for him in the world
to come, frequently endeavored to convert him.
Many were the tears they shed. At last one day,
after they had pleaded with him more earnestly
still than before, the father, touched by their
supplications, promised to
shoot no more. But, after a
a while, some of his neighbors
came round to request
him to shoot for them
two storks.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> He was easily
led to consent by the
strength of his natural
liking for the sport. Still
he would not allow a word
to be breathed to his daughters. He slipped
out at night, gun in hand, after they were, as he
imagined, fast asleep.</p>

<span class="caption">The Two White Birds.</span>
</div>

<p>They, however, had heard everything, and the
elder sister said to the younger: "Do what we
may, our father will not condescend to follow our
words of counsel, and nothing now remains but
to bring him to a knowledge of the truth by the
sacrifice of one of our own lives. To-night is
fortunately moonless; and if I put on white garments
and go to the neighborhood of the bay, he
will take me for a stork and shoot me dead. Do
you continue to live and tend our father with all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
the services of filial piety." Thus she spake, her
eyes dimmed with the rolling tears. But the
younger sister, with many sobs, exclaimed: "For
you, my sister, for you is it to receive the
inheritance of this house. So do you condescend
to be the one to live, and to practise filial
devotion to our father, while I will offer up my
life."</p>

<p>Thus did each strive for death. The elder one,
without more words, seizing a white garment
rushed out of the house. The younger one, unwilling
to cede to her the place of honor, putting
on a white gown also, followed in her track to
the shore of the bay. There, making her way
to her among the rushes, she continued the dispute
as to which of the two should be the one
to die.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the father, peering around him in
the darkness, saw something white. Taking it
for the storks, he aimed at the spot with his gun,
and did not miss his shot, for it pierced through
the ribs of the elder of the two girls. The
younger, helpless in her grief, bent over her sister's
body. The father, not dreaming of what he
was about, and astonished to find that his having
shot one of the storks did not make the other fly
away, discharged another shot at the remaining
white figure. Lamentable to relate, he hit his
second daughter as he had the first. She fell,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
pierced through the chest, and was laid on the
same grassy pillow as her sister.</p>

<p>The father, pleased with his success, came
up to the rushes to look for his game. But
what! no storks, alas! alas! No, only his two
daughters! Filled with consternation, he asked
what it all meant. The girls, breathing with
difficulty, told him that their resolve had been
to show him the crime of taking life, and thus
respectfully to cause him to desist therefrom.
They expired before they had time to say
more.</p>

<p>The father was filled with sorrow and remorse.
He took the two corpses home on his
back. As there was now no help for what was
done, he placed them reverently on a wood stack,
and there they burnt, making smoke to the blowing
wind. From that hour he was a converted
man. He built himself a small cell of branches
of trees, near the village bridge. Placing therein
the memorial tablets of his two daughters, he
performed before them the due religious rites,
and became the most pious follower of Buddha.
Ah! that was filial piety in very truth! a marvel,
that these girls should throw away their own
lives, so that, by exterminating the evil seed in
their father's conduct in this world, they might
guard him from its awful fruit in the world
to come!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="SECOND_SIGHT" id="SECOND_SIGHT"></a>SECOND SIGHT.</h2>

<p>A traveller arrived at a village, and looking
about for an inn, he found one that, although
rather shabby, would, he thought, suit him. So
he asked whether he could pass the night there,
and the mistress said certainly. No one lived at
the inn except the mistress, so that the traveller
was quite undisturbed.</p>

<p>The next morning, after he had finished break-fast,
the traveller went out of the house to make
arrangements for continuing his journey. To
his surprise, his hostess asked him to stop a
moment. She said that he owed her a thousand
pounds, solemnly declaring that he had borrowed
that sum from her inn long years ago. The
traveller was astonished greatly at this, as it
seemed to him a preposterous demand. So
fetching his trunk, he soon hid himself by drawing
a curtain all round him.</p>

<p>After thus secluding himself for some time, he
called the woman and asked, "Was your father
an adept in the art of second sight?" The
woman replied, "Yes; my father secluded himself
just as you have done." Said the traveller,
"Explain fully to me why you say I owe you so
large a sum." The mistress then related that
when her father was going to die, he bequeathed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
her all his possessions except his money. He
said, that on a certain day, ten years later, a
traveller would lodge at her house, and that, as
the said traveller owed him a thousand pounds,
she could reclaim at that time this sum from his
debtor. She must subsist in the meanwhile by
the gradual sale of her father's goods.</p>

<p>Hitherto, being unable to earn as much money
as she spent, she had been disposing of the inherited
valuables, but had now exhausted nearly
all of them. In the meantime, the predicted date
had arrived, and a traveller had lodged at her
house, just as her father had foretold. Hence
she concluded he was the man from whom she
should recover the thousand pounds.</p>

<p>On hearing this the traveller said that all that
the woman had related was perfectly true. Taking
her to one side of the room, he told her to
tap gently with her knuckles all over a wooden
pillar. At one part the pillar gave forth a hollow
sound. The traveller said that the money spoken
about by the poor woman lay hidden in this part
of the pillar. Then advising her to spend it only
gradually, he went on his way.</p>

<p>The father of this woman had been extremely
skilful in the art of second sight or clairvoyance.
By its means he had discovered that his daughter
would pass through ten years of extreme poverty
and that on a certain future day a diviner would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
come and lodge in the house. The father was
also aware that if he bequeathed his daughter his
money at once, she would spend it extravagantly.
Upon consideration, therefore, he hid the money
in the pillar, and instructed his daughter as related.
In accordance with the father's prophecy,
the man came and lodged in the house on the
predicted day, and by the art of divination discovered
the thousand pounds.</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="nodisp">T</span>he games we are daily playing
at in our nurseries, or
some of them, have been also
played at for centuries by
Japanese boys and girls. Such
are blindman's buff (eye-hiding),
puss-in-the-corner, catching,
racing, scrambling, a
variety of "here we go round
the mulberry bush." The
game of knuckle-bones is played with five little
stuffed bags instead of sheep bones, which the
children cannot get, as sheep are not used by
the Japanese. Also performances such as honey-pots,
heads in chancery, turning round back to
back, or hand to hand, are popular among that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
long-sleeved, shaven-pated small fry. Still better
than snow-balling, the lads like to make a snow-man,
with a round charcoal ball for each eye, and
a streak of charcoal for his mouth. This they call
Buddha's squat follower "Daruma," whose legs
rotted off through his stillness over his lengthy
prayers.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="nodisp">A</span>s might be expected, some of the Japanese
games differ slightly from ours, or else are altogether
peculiar to that country. The facility
with which a Japanese child slips its shoes on
and off, and the absence on the part of the
parents of conventional or health scruples regarding
bare feet, lead to a sort of game of ball
in which the shoes take the part of the ball, and
to hiding pranks with the sandal, something like
our hunt the slipper and hide-and-seek. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
the other hand, kago play is entirely Japanese.
In this game, two children carry a bamboo pole
on their shoulders, on to which clings a third
child, in imitation of a usual mode of travelling
in Japan. In this the passenger is seated in a
light bamboo palanquin borne on men's shoulders.
A miniature festival is
thought great fun, when
a few bits of rough wood
mounted on wheels are
decorated with cut paper
and evergreens, and drawn
slowly along amidst the
shouts of the exultant contrivers,
in mimicry of the
real festival cars. Games
of soldiers are of two
types. When copied from
the historical fights, one
boy, with his kerchief
bound round his temples,
makes a supposed marvelous
and heroic defence. He slashes with his
bamboo sword, as a harlequin waves his baton, to
deal magical destruction all around on the attacking
party. When the late insurrection commenced
in Satsuma, the Tokio boys, hearing of
the campaign on modern tactics, would form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
attack and defence parties. A little company
armed with bamboo breech-loaders would march
to the assault of the roguish battalion lurking
round the corner.</p>

<p>Wrestling, again, is popular with children, not
so much on account of the actual throwing, as
from the love of imitating the curious growling
an animal-like springing, with which the professional
wrestlers encounter one another. Swimming,
fishing, and general puddling about are congenial
occupation for hot summer days; whilst
some with a toy bamboo pump, like a Japanese
feeble fire-engine, manage to send a squirt of water
at a friend, as the firemen souse their comrades<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
standing on the burning housetops. Itinerant
street sellers have, on stalls of a height suited to
their little customers, an array of what looks like
pickles. This is made of bright seaweed pods
that the children buy to make a "clup!" sort of
noise with between their lips, so that they go
about apparently hiccoughing all day long. The
smooth glossy leaves of the camellia, as common
as hedge roses are in England, make very fair
little trumpets when blown after having been
expertly rolled up, or in spring their fallen blossoms
are strung into gay chains.</p>

<p>On a border-land between games and sweets
are the stalls of the itinerant batter-sellers. At
these the tiny purchaser enjoys the evidently
much appreciated privilege of himself arranging
his little measure of batter in fantastic forms, and
drying them upon a hot metal plate. A turtle is
a favorite design, as the first blotch of batter
makes its body, and six judiciously arranged

<p class="dropcap"><span class="nodisp">H</span>ow often in Japan one sees that the children of
a larger growth enjoy with equal zest games which
are the same, or nearly the same, as those of lesser<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
size and fewer years! Certain it is that the adults
do all in their power to provide for the children
their full quota of play and harmless sports. We
frequently see full-grown and able-bodied natives
indulging in amusements which the men of the
West lay aside with their pinafores, or when their
curls are cut. If we, in the conceited pride of
our superior civilization, look down upon this as
childish, we must remember
that the Oriental, from
the pinnacle of his lofty,
and to him immeasurably
elevated, civilization, looks
down upon our manly
sports with contempt,
thinking it a condescension
even to notice them.</p>

<p>A very noticeable
change has passed over
the Japanese people since
the modern advent of foreigners in respect to
their love of amusement. Their sports are by no
means as numerous or elaborate as formerly, and
they do not enter into them with the enthusiasm
that formerly characterized them. The children's
festivals and sports are rapidly losing their importance,
and some now are rarely seen. Formerly the
holidays were almost as numerous as saints' days in
the calendar. Apprentice-boys had a liberal quota<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
of holidays stipulated in their indentures; and as
the children counted the days before each great
holiday on their fingers, we may believe that a great
deal of digital arithmetic was being continually
done. We do not know of any country in the world
in which there are so many toy-shops or so many
fairs for the sale of things which delight children.
Not only are the streets of every city
abundantly supplied with shops, filled as full as
a Christmas stocking with gaudy toys, but in
small towns and villages one or more children's
bazaars may be found. The most gorgeous display
of all things pleasing to the eye of a
Japanese child is found in the courts or streets
leading to celebrated temples. On a festival
day, the toy-sellers and itinerant showmen throng
with their most attractive wares or sights in front
of the shrine or temple. On the walls and in
conspicuous places near the churches and cathedrals
in Europe and America, the visitor is usually
regaled with the sight of undertakers' signs
and gravediggers' advertisements. How differently
the Japanese act in these respects let any
one see, by visiting one or all of the three greatest
temples in Tokio, or one of the numerous smaller
shrines on some renowned festival day.</p>

<p>We have not space in this paper to name or
describe the numerous street shows and showmen
who are supposed to be interested mainly in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
entertaining children; though in reality adults
form a part, often the major part, of their audiences.
Any one desirous of seeing these in full
glory must ramble down some of the side streets
in Tokio, on some fair day, and especially on a
general holiday.</p>

<p>Among the most common are the street theatricals,
in which two, three, or four trained boys
and girls do some very creditable acting, chiefly
in comedy. Raree shows, in which the looker-on
sees the inside splendors of the nobles' homes,
or the heroic acts of Japanese warriors, or some
famous natural scenery, are very common. The
showman, as he pulls the wires that change the
scenes, entertains the spectators with songs. The
outside of his box is usually adorned with pictures
of famous actors, nine-tailed foxes, demons of all
colors, people committing hari-kiri or stomach
cutting, bloody massacres, or some such staple
horror in which the normal Japanese so delights.
Story-tellers, posturers, dancers, actors of charades,
conjurers, flute-players, song-singers are found on
these streets, but those who specially delight the
children are the men who, by dint of fingers and
breath, work a paste made of wheat-gluten into all
sorts of curious and gayly-smeared toys, such as
flowers, trees, noblemen, fair ladies, various utensils,
the foreigner, the jin-riki-sha, etc. Nearly
every itinerant seller of candy, starch-cakes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
sugared peas, and sweetened beans, has several
methods of lottery by which he adds to the attractions
on his stall. A disk having a revolving
arrow, whirled round by the hand of a child, or a
number of strings which are connected with the
faces of imps, goddesses, devils, or heroes, lends
the excitement of chance, and, when a lucky pull
or whirl occurs, occasions the subsequent addition
to the small fraction of a sen's worth to be bought.
Men or women walk about, carrying a small charcoal
brazier under a copper griddle, with batter,
spoons, cups, and shoyu<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> sauce to hire out for the
price of a jumon<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> each to the little urchins who
spend an afternoon of bliss, making their own
griddle-cakes and eating them. The seller of
sugar-jelly exhibits a devil, taps a drum, and
dances for the benefit of his baby-customers.
The seller of nice pastry does the same, with the
addition of gymnastics and skilful tricks with balls
of dough. In every Japanese city there are scores,
if not hundreds of men and women who obtain a
livelihood by amusing the children.</p>

<p>Some of the games of Japanese children are of
a national character, and are indulged in by all
classes. Others are purely local or exclusive.
Among the former are those which belong to the
great festival days, which in the old calendar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
(before 1872) enjoyed vastly more importance than
under the new one. Beginning with the first of
the year, there are a number of games and sports
peculiar to this time. The girls, dressed in their
best robes and girdles, with their faces powdered
and their lips painted, until they resemble the
peculiar colors seen on a beetle's wings, and
their hair arranged in the most attractive coiffure,
are out upon the street playing battledore and
shuttlecock. They play not only in twos and
threes, but also in circles. The shuttlecock is a
small seed, often gilded, stuck round with feathers
arranged like the petals of a flower. The battledore
is a wooden bat; one side of which is of bare
wood, while the other has the raised effigy of some
popular actor, hero of romance, or singing girl in
the most ultra-Japanese style of beauty. The girls
evidently highly appreciate this game, as it gives
abundant opportunity for the display of personal
beauty, figure, and dress. Those who fail in the
game often have their faces marked with ink, or
a circle drawn round the eyes. The boys sing a
song that the wind will blow, the girls sing that it
may be calm so that their shuttlecocks may fly
straight. The little girls at this time play with a
ball made of cotton cord, covered elaborately with
many strands of bright vari-colored silk.</p>

<p>Inside the house they have games suited not
only for the daytime, but for the evenings. Many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
foreigners have wondered what the Japanese do
at night, and how the long winter evenings are
spent. On fair, and especially moonlight nights,
most of the people are out of doors, and many of
the children with them. Markets and fairs are
held regularly at night in Tokio, and in other
large cities. The foreigner living in a Japanese
city, even if he were blind, could tell by stepping
out of doors, whether the weather were clear and
fine, or disagreeable. On dark and stormy nights
the stillness of a great city like Tokio is unbroken
and very impressive; but on a fair and moonlight
night the hum and bustle tell one that the people
are out in throngs, and make one feel that it
is a city that he lives in.</p>

<p>In most of the castle towns in Japan, it was
formerly the custom of the people, especially of
the younger, to assemble on moonlight nights in
the streets or open spaces near the castle gates,
and dance a sort of subdued dance, moving round
in circles and clapping their hands. These dances
often continued during the entire night, the following
day being largely consumed in sleep. In
the winter evenings in Japanese households the
Japanese children amuse themselves with their
sports, or are amused by their elders, who tell
them entertaining stories. The Samurai father
relates to his son Japanese history and heroic
lore, to fire him with enthusiasm and a love of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
those achievements which every Samurai youth
hopes at some day to perform. Then there are
numerous social entertainments, at which the
children above a certain age are allowed to be
present.</p>

<p>But the games relied on as standard means of
amusement, and seen especially about New Year,
are those of cards. In one of these, a large,
square sheet of paper is laid on the floor. On
this card are the names and pictures of the fifty-three
post-stations between old Yedo and Kioto.
At the place Kioto are put a few coins, or a pile
of cakes, or some such prizes, and the game is
played with dice. Each throw advances the
player toward the goal, and the one arriving first
obtains the prize. At this time of the year, also,
the games of what we may call literary cards are
played a great deal. The Iroha Garuta <a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> are small
cards each containing a proverb. The proverb is
printed on one card, and the picture illustrating it
upon another. Each proverb begins with a certain
one of the fifty Japanese letters, i, ro, ha, etc., and so
through the syllabary. The children range themselves
in a circle, and the cards are shuffled and
dealt. One is appointed to be reader. Looking
at his cards he reads the proverb. The player
who has the picture corresponding to the proverb
calls out, and the match is made. Those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
are rid of their cards first, win the game. The
one holding the last card is the loser. If he be
a boy, he has his face marked curiously with ink.
If a girl, she has a paper or wisp of straw stuck
in her hair.</p>

<p>The One Verse (from each of the) Hundred
Poets game consists of two hundred cards, on
which are inscribed the one hundred stanzas or
poems so celebrated and known in every household.
A stanza of Japanese poetry usually consists
of two parts, a first and second, or upper
and lower clause. The manner of playing the
game is as follows: The reader reads half the
stanza on his card, and the player, having the card
on which the other half is written, calls out, and
makes a match. Some children become so
familiar with these poems that they do not need
to hear the entire half of the stanza read, but
frequently only the first word.</p>

<p>The game of Ancient Odes, that named after the
celebrated Genji (Minamoto) family of the Middle
Ages, and the Shi Garuta are all card-games of
a similar nature, but can be thoroughly enjoyed
only by well-educated Chinese scholars, as the
references and quotations are written in Chinese
and require a good knowledge of the Chinese
and Japanese classics to play them well. To
boys who are eager to become proficient in Chinese
it often acts as an incentive to be told that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
they will enjoy these games after certain attainments
in scholarship have been made. Having
made these attainments, they play the game frequently,
especially during vacation, to impress on
their minds what they have already learned.</p>

<p>Two other games are played which may be said
to have an educational value. They are the
"Wisdom Boards" and the "Ring of Wisdom."
The former consists of a number of flat thin pieces
of wood, cut in many geometrical shapes. Certain
possible figures are printed on paper as models,
and the boy tries to form them out of the pieces
given him. In some cases much time and thinking
are required to form the figure. The ring-puzzle
is made of rings of bamboo or iron, on a
bar. Boys having a talent for mathematics, or
those who have a natural capacity to distinguish
size and form, succeed very well at these games
and enjoy them.</p>

<p>The game of Checkers is played on a raised
stand or table about six inches in height. The
number of "go" or checkers, including black and
white, is 360. In the Sho-gi, or game of Chess,
the pieces number 40 in all. Backgammon is also
a favorite play, and there are several forms of it.</p>

<span class="caption">Getting Ready to Raise the big Humming Kite with the Sun
Emblem.</span>
</div>

<p>About the time of old style New Year's Day,
when the winds of February and March are favorable
to the sport, kites are flown, and there are
few games in which Japanese boys, from the infant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
on the back to the full-grown and the over-grown
boy, take more delight. I have never observed,
however, as foreign books so often tell us, old men
flying kites and boys merely looking on. The
Japanese kites are made of tough paper pasted on
a frame of bamboo sticks, and are usually of a rectangular
shape. Some of them, however, are
made to represent children or men, several kinds
of birds and animals, fans, etc. On the rectangular
kites are pictures of ancient heroes or beautiful
women, dragons, horses, monsters of various
kinds, the symbol of the sun, or huge Chinese
characters. Among the faces most frequently
seen on these kites are those of the national
heroes or heroines. Some of the kites are six feet
square. Many of them have a thin tense ribbon
of whalebone at the top of the kite which vibrates
in the wind, making a loud humming noise. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
boys frequently name their kites Genji or Héiki,
and each contestant endeavors to destroy that of
his rival. For this purpose the string for ten or
twenty feet near the kite end is first covered with
glue, and then dipped into pounded glass, by which
the string becomes covered with tiny blades, each
able to cut quickly and deeply. By getting the
kite in proper position and suddenly sawing the
string of his antagonist, the severed kite falls, to
be reclaimed by the victor.</p>

<p>The Japanese tops are of several kinds, some
are made of univalve shells, filled with wax. Those
intended for contests are made of hard wood, and
are iron-clad by having a heavy iron ring round
as a sort of tire. The boys wind and throw them
in a manner somewhat different from ours. The
object of the player is to damage his adversary's
top, or to make it cease spinning. The whipping
top is also known and used. Besides the athletic
sports of leaping, running, wrestling, slinging, the
Japanese boys play at blindman's buff, hiding-whoop,
and with stilts, pop-guns, and blow-guns.
On stilts they play various games and run races.</p>

<p>In the northern and western coast provinces,
where the snow falls to the depth of many feet
and remains long on the ground, it forms the material
of the children's playthings, and the theatre
of many of their sports. Besides sliding on the
ice, coasting with sleds, building snow-forts and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
fighting mimic battles with snow-balls, they make
many kinds of images and imitations of what they
see and know. In America the boy's snow-man
is a Paddy with a damaged hat, clay pipe in
mouth, and the shillelah in his hand. In Japan
the snow-man is an image of Daruma. Daruma
was one of the followers of Shaka (Buddha) who,
by long meditation in a squatting position, lost
his legs from paralysis and sheer decay. The
images of Daruma are found by the hundreds in
toy-shops, as tobacconists' signs, and as the snow-men
of the boys. Occasionally the figure of Géiho,
the sage with a forehead and skull so high that a
ladder was required to reach his pate, or huge cats
and the peculiar-shaped dogs seen in the toy-shops,
take the place of Daruma.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 291px;">

<span class="caption">Daruma, the Snow-Image.</span>
</div>

<p>Many of the amusements of the children in-doors
are mere imitations of the serious affairs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
adult life. Boys who have been to the theatre
come home to imitate the celebrated actors, and
to extemporize mimic theatricals for themselves.
Feigned sickness and "playing the doctor," imitating
with ludicrous exactness the pomp and
solemnity of the real man of pills and powders,
and the misery of the patient, are the diversions
of very young children. Dinners, tea-parties, and
even weddings and funerals, are imitated in Japanese
children's plays.</p>

<p>Among the ghostly games intended to test the
courage of, or perhaps to frighten children, are two
plays called respectively, the "One Hundred
Stories" and "Soul-Examination." In the former
play, a company of boys and girls assemble round
the hibachi, while they or an adult, an aged person
or a servant, usually relate ghost stories, or tales
calculated to straighten the hair and make the
blood crawl. In a distant dark room, a lamp (the
usual dish of oil) with a wick of one hundred
strands or piths, is set. At the conclusion of each
story, the children in turn must go to the dark
room and remove a strand of the wick. As the
lamp burns down low the room becomes gloomy
and dark, and the last boy, it is said, always sees
a demon, a huge face, or something terrible. In
"Soul-Examination," a number of boys during
the day plant some flags in different parts of
a graveyard, under a lonely tree, or by a haunted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
hill-side. At night they meet together and tell
stories about ghosts, goblins, devils, etc., and at
the conclusion of each tale, when the imagination
is wrought up, the boys, one at a time, must go
out in the dark and bring back the flags, until all
are brought in.</p>

<p>On the third day of the third month is held the
Doll Festival. This is the day especially devoted
to the girls, and to them it is the greatest day in
the year. It has been called in some foreign
works on Japan, the "Feast of Dolls." Several
days before the Matsuri the shops are gay with
the images bought for this occasion, and which
are on sale only at this time of year. Every respectable
family has a number of these splendidly-dressed
images, which are from four inches to a
foot in height, and which accumulate from generation
to generation. When a daughter is born
in the house during the previous year, a pair of
hina or images are purchased for the little girl,
which she plays with until grown up. When
she is married her hina are taken with her to her
husband's house, and she gives them to her children,
adding to the stock as her family increases.
The images are made of wood or enamelled clay.
They represent the Mikado and his wife; the
kugé or old Kioto nobles, their wives and daughters,
the court minstrels, and various personages
in Japanese mythology and history. A great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
many other toys, representing all the articles in
use in a Japanese lady's chamber, the service of
the eating table, the utensils of the kitchen, travelling
apparatus, etc., some of them very elaborate
and costly, are also exhibited and played with on
this day. The girls make offerings of saké and
dried rice, etc., to the effigies of the emperor and
empress, and then spend the day with toys, mimicking
the whole round of Japanese female life, as
that of child, maiden, wife, mother, and grand-mother.
In some old Japanese families in which
I have visited, the display of dolls and images was
very large and extremely beautiful.</p>

<p>The greatest day in the year for the boys is on
the fifth day of the fifth month. On this day is
celebrated what has been called the "Feast of
Flags." Previous to the coming of the day, the
shops display for sale the toys and tokens proper
to the occasion. These are all of a kind suited
to young Japanese masculinity. They consist of
effigies of heroes and warriors, generals and commanders,
soldiers on foot and horse, the genii of
strength and valor, wrestlers, etc. The toys represent
the equipments and regalia of a daimio's
procession, all kinds of things used in war, the
contents of an arsenal, flags, streamers, banners,
etc. A set of these toys is bought for every son
born in the family. Hence in old Japanese families
the display on the fifth day of the fifth month<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
is extensive and brilliant. Besides the display in-doors,
on a bamboo pole erected outside is hung,
by a string to the top of the pole, a representation
of a large fish in paper. The paper being hollow,
the breeze easily fills out the body of the fish, which
flaps its tail and fins in a natural manner. One
may count hundreds of these floating in the air
over the city.</p>

<p>The nobori, as the paper fish is called, is intended
to show that a son has been born during
the year, or at least that there are sons in the
family. The fish represented is the carp, which
is able to swim swiftly against the current and to
leap over waterfalls. This act of the carp is a
favorite subject with native artists, and is also
typical of the young man, especially the young
Samurai, mounting over all difficulties to success
and quiet prosperity.</p>

<p>One favorite game, which has now gone out of
fashion, was that in which the boys formed themselves
into a daimio's procession, having forerunners,
officers, etc., and imitating as far as possible
the pomp and circumstance of the old daimio's
train. Another game which was very popular
represented, in mimic war, the struggles of two
great noble families (like the red and white
roses of England). The boys of a town, district,
or school, ranged themselves into two parties,
each with flags. Those of the Héiki were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
white, those of the Genji red. Sometimes every
boy had a flag, and the object of the contest, which
was begun at the tap of a gun, was to seize the
flags of the enemy. The party securing the
greatest number of flags won the victory. In
other cases the flags were fastened on the back
of each contestant, who was armed with a bamboo
for a sword, and who had fastened on a pad
over his head a flat round piece of earthenware,
so that a party of them looked not unlike the faculty
of a college. Often these parties of boys
numbered several hundred, and were marshalled
in squadrons as in a battle. At a given signal
the battle commenced, the object being to break
the earthen disk on the head of the enemy. The
contest was usually very exciting. Whoever had
his earthen disk demolished had to retire from
the field. The party having the greatest number
of broken disks, indicative of cloven skulls, were
declared the losers. This game has been forbidden
by the Government as being too severe and
cruel. Boys were often injured in it.</p>

<p>There are many other games which we simply
mention without describing. There are three
games played by the hands, which every observant
foreigner long resident in Japan must have
seen played, as men and women seem to enjoy
them as much as children. In the Stone game,
a stone, a pair of scissors, and a wrapping-cloth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
are represented. The stone signifies the
clenched fist, the parted fore and middle fingers
the scissors, and the curved forefinger and
thumb the cloth. The scissors can cut the
cloth, but not the stone, but the cloth can wrap
the stone. The two players sit opposite each other
at play, throwing out their hands so as to represent
either of the three things, and win, lose, or
draw, as the case may be.</p>

<p>In the Fox game, the fox, man, and gun are
the figures. The gun kills the fox, but the fox
deceives the man, and the gun is useless without
the man. In the third game, five or six boys
represent the various grades of rank, from the
peasant up to the great daimios or shogun. By
superior address and skill in the game the peasant
rises to the highest rank, or the man of highest
rank is degraded.</p>

<p>From the nature of the Japanese language, in
which a single word or sound may have a great
many significations, riddles and puns are of extraordinary
frequency. I do not know of any published
collection of riddles, but every Japanese boy has
a good stock of them on hand. There are few
Japanese works of light, and perhaps of serious,
literature, in which puns do not continually recur.
The popular songs and poems are largely plays
on words. There are also several puzzles played
with sticks, founded upon the shape of certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
Chinese characters. As for the short and simple
story-books, song-books, nursery rhymes, lullabys,
and what for want of a better name may be styled
Mother Goose Literature, they are as plentiful as
with us, but they have a very strongly characteristic
Japanese flavor, both in style and matter.</p>

<p>It is curious that the game of foot-ball seems
to have been confined to the courtiers of the
Mikado's court, where there were regular instructors
of the game. In the games of Pussy
wants a Corner and Prisoner's Base, the Oni,
or devil, takes the place of Puss or the officer.</p>

<p>I have not mentioned all the games and sports
of Japanese children, but enough has been said
to show their general character. In general they
seem to be natural, sensible, and in every sense
beneficial. Their immediate or remote effects,
next to that of amusement, are either educational,
or hygienic. Some teach history, some geography,
some excellent sentiments or good language.
Others inculcate reverence and obedience to the
elder brother or sister, to parents or to the
emperor, or stimulate the manly virtues of courage
and contempt for pain. The study of the
subject leads one to respect more highly, rather
than otherwise, the Japanese people for being
such affectionate fathers and mothers, and for
having such natural and docile children. The
character of the children's plays and their encouragement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
by the parents has, I think, much to do
with that frankness, affection, and obedience on
the side of the children, and that kindness and
sympathy on the side of the parents, which are
so noticeable in Japan, and which is one of the
many good points of Japanese life and character.</p>

<p class="center" style="font-size: 125%;">AN ELEMENTARY HISTORY OF<br />
THE UNITED STATES</p>

<p class="center" style="width: 100%; border-bottom: double;">By ALLEN C. THOMAS, A. M.
<br />
<small><i>Author of "A History of the United States," and Professor of History
in Haverford College.</i></small><br />&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Elementary History is for the use of younger
classes, and serves as an introduction to the
author's larger History of the United States.</p>

<p>Effort has been made to present such important phases
of national growth as the difficulties and dangers of exploration,
and how they were overcome by earnestness
and perseverance; the risks and hardships of settlement,
and how they were met and conquered; the independence
and patriotism of the colonists, and how they
triumphed; the effect of environment upon character;
the development of the people in politics and government
and in social life; and the progress of invention
and its effect upon national development.</p>

<p>Realizing the fascination that the personalities of our
national heroes have for the young, the author has
chosen those men who best illustrate the important
periods in the making of our nation, and in a series
of interesting biographical sketches uses their lives as
centers around which the history is written. Thus the
book has all the freshness and vitality, all the rapidity
of action, and all the interest, of tales of patriotism and
courage and untiring endurance, and yet preserves accuracy
of fact and due proportion of importance of events.</p>

<p class="title" style="width: 100%; border-bottom: double;"><span class="h2">THE HEATH READERS</span></p>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: .2em;">A new series, that excels in its</p>

<ol style="margin-top: 0em;"><li>Interesting and well graded lessons.</li>
<li>Masterpieces of English and American literature.</li>
<li>Beautiful and appropriate illustrations.</li>
<li>Clear and legible printing.</li>
<li>Durable and handsome binding.</li>
<li>Adaptation to the needs of modern schools.</li>
</ol>

<p style="width: 100%; border-top: double;"><br /><span class="smcap">The Heath Readers</span> enable teachers, whether they
have much or little knowledge of the art, to teach children to
read intelligently and to read aloud intelligibly. They do this
without waste of time or effort, and at the same time that the
books aid pupils in acquiring skill in reading, they present
material which is in itself worth reading.</p>
<hr class="ads" />

<p>The purpose of the <span class="smcap">Heath Readers</span> is, <i>first</i>, to enable
beginners to master the mechanical difficulties of reading
successfully and in the shortest time; <i>second</i>, to develop the
imagination and cultivate a taste for the best literature;
<i>third</i>, to appeal to those motives that lead to right conduct,
industry, courage, patriotism, and loyalty to duty. The larger
purpose is, briefly, to aid in developing an appreciation of
that which is of most worth in life and literature.</p>
<hr class="ads" />

<p class="center"><small>The series contains seven books, as follows:</small></p>
